# rectangleSect

Name: David J DeBonis

## what this program does
This program takes information of two rectangles plotted in a 2D plane and determines whether the rectangles intersect.*

*if the rectangles share a single point, such as a corner, this is considered intersection.

### input:
For each rectangle, the user inputs the (x,y) coordinates of the top-left point, as well as the height and width of the rectangle.

### output:
For each rectangle, the program will output all four of the rectangle's coordinates, the height and width, and a declarative statement of whether the rectangles intersect.

## how to run
This program runs when compiled with g++/gcc.

In a terminal (on a Unix machine), make a clone of the repository in the directory you want it using the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/djdebonis/rectangleSect.git
```
then navigate to the repository:
```bash
cd rectangleSect/
```
Next you will compile the output/executable file using the make command:
```bash
make
```
if you type `ls` you will now see a file named `a.out` in the repository. To run the file, type:
```bash
./a.out
```
and the program will run.

## status
it runs!
